Yet another Pokedex!

## Why, just why?

I was given the interview task of creating an Angular application consuming PokeAPI (thank you guys for your hard work <3) and here is it! It's pretty useless, missing some crucial features and not so well polished, but combining studies, current job and additional activities isn't easy :(

## So, what libraries have you used?

* Angular CDK
* ngx-progressbar
* digitOnly

## Did you get the job?

Not know at the moment. Will add note with recruitment process result. Cross your fingers!
